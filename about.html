        <h1>I'm Nasrin. <span>Welcome to my personal portfolio.</span></h1>
        <p>I am a Doctor of Design in Cultural Preservation candidate (Fabricative Cultures: Materials & Technology areas of specialization). 
          <br>I received a Master of Fine Art in Ceramics from the University of Alabama, and a Master of Arts in Handicrafts from the Tehran University of Art. 
          <br>I have worked on contemporary ceramic using robotic technologies and explores the future of digital craft. My work is also engaged in a dialogue between traditional Persian art and western contemporary art. She juxtaposes these concepts in physical forms to build a bridge between traditional values and modern concepts. 
          I have actively exhibited her work at the biennales and exhibitions such as London Art Biennale in London (UK), Artigiano in Fiera Handicraft Exhibition in Milan (Italy), Fitur exhibition Feria Internacional de Turismo in Madrid (Spain), International Integrated Design Camp in Seoul (South Korea), International Handicraft Exhibition in Tehran (Iran), Clay Studio National Ceramic Exhibition in Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Content Matters Exhibition of Marin MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) in Novato, (California), and more.
